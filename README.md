# Computational-Neuroscience
Projects in Matlab for Neuroscientists book

In this section I am publishing several of projects on MATLAB for neuroscientist book. You can find readme.txt for each project in their
respective files. Since experiments on the first 3 projects have been performed, I have also reported its results in microsoft word format.

Data are obtained from book's webpage. However, there are 2 editions for the book and some of the data differ in terms of format. Therefore,
I also added code for merging those different datasets in respective projects.

Feel free to as questions if there is a problem running the codes.
